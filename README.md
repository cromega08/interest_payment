## Challenge

We have the information about the following N savings accounts of a banking organization:

* Account number, of type **_String_**.

* Opening date, type **_String_** of **_length 10_**, format **_“yyyy/mm/dd”_ (Year/Month/Day)**.

* Type of account **_(1: Daily Savings, 2: Young Account, 3: Traditional)_**, of type **_int_**.

* Account balance, of type **_float_**.

The bank want to create a program in **_JAVA_**, using structured programming, that calculates and displays the following information:

* Account number

* Monthly interest value of the account

* Balance of the account with the increase in the interest value.

* Show the total amount of interest on all accounts.

* Shows the sum of total balances.

In addition, they provide the information to calculate the interest value of the account, which depends on the type of account, as follows:

| Account Type | (%) monthly interest|
| ---|---|
| 1. Daily Savings | 1.5 |
| 2. Young Account | 1.7 |
| 3. Traditional | 1.6 |
